==Abstract==

This NCIP describes ''Wallet Nodes'', a special use of full nodes which provide data for light wallets. Light wallets are those wallets without a local copy of the blockchain. They can be desktop wallets or mobile wallets.
A Wallet Node provider helps the network to attend those kind of wallets, giving the owner of the Wallet Node the option to charge a fee for his service.

==Motivation==

# Smartphones' wallets and desktop users with poor Internet connection need to obtain data from the network while it is impractical to them to download the full blockchain. Their only option is to make use of a remote node with its RPC port open to the Internet.
# It is essential to encourage community based entrepreneurship, attracting players to become a Wallet Node provider, monetizing from their service and expanding network capacity so it can support the growing number of mobile wallets.

==Specification==

A Wallet Node is essentially a full node with a special purpose. The ability to charge a fee from the connected wallets, when they make a sending transaction, is activated through a pair of command line options.

===Specification guidelines===

The following parameters are considered when creating a Wallet Node:

# '''Fee Address''' is the destination wallet address for the fee payments. This is the wallet of the Wallet Node's owner.
# '''Maximum WN Fee''' is expressed in units of coins (NBR). This is an upper limit for the fee charged, per transaction. It is not defined by the Wallet Node's owner.
# '''Fee''' is a percentage of the transaction's amount. Not to be confused with the network fee, which still applies. The effective fee charged will be calculated as ''fee * amount / 100'' or 'Maximum WN Fee'', whichever is lower.
# '''Hostname''' is the public URL of the server on the Internet. The end user must use this value to enter on his wallet settings.
# '''Port''' is the port of the server on the Internet. The end user must use this value to enter on his wallet settings. Default value is 8314.

===Use===

A Wallet Node is initialized by running the ''niobiod daemon'' which can be found and compiled from the github repository [https://github.com/niobio-cash/niobio-node-daemon Niobio-Node-Daemon]. It is recommended to compile the binaries locally.

The following command can be used to start the daemon. This example is for Linux and MacOS platforms.

/<nowiki><path></nowiki>/niobiod --enable-blockchain-indexes --restricted-rpc --rpc-bind-ip 0.0.0.0 --fee-address <nowiki><fee Address></nowiki> --fee <nowiki><fee></nowiki>

===Functional Diagram===

The figure below ilustrates the functional environment of a Wallet Node.

===Requirements===

The minimal requirements of a server to run a Wallet Node are numerated below. More resources can be needed depending on the number of light wallets connected to the Wallet Node and their use behaviour.

# 2 vCPU
# 2 GB RAM
# 100Mbps Ethernet Card
# 50 GB Hard Disk (SSD recommended)
# 1 TB of upload data per month
# Static public IP address
# DNS resolution

==Additional Information==

It is not require to have any amount of NBR coins on the wallet used for the Wallet Node. Any person with enough technical skills can become a Wallet Node provider.
