If you want to submit a NCIP, first propose your idea to the Niobio Cash [https://gitter.im/NiobioCoin|Gitter-Room]. After discussion, please open a Pull Request. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

Having a NCIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Niobio Cash users.
